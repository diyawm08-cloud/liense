          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that Wild Mind AI by Wild Child Studios operates as a technology service provider and an intermediary platform (SaaS). The Service provides tools that facilitate the creation of user-generated content using third-party AI models and proprietary technology.

          </p>
          <p>
            The Service is provided "AS IS." The Company disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and quality or accuracy of any AI-generated content.

            You retain all ownership rights to the data, content, and materials you upload, input, or provide to the Service ("Input Data"), including text prompts, reference images, and voice samples. You grant the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and process the Input Data solely for the purpose of operating, maintaining, improving, and developing the Service and underlying models, subject to the limitations set forth in the Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for all applicable taxes and agree to the specific usage limits and credit consumption rates defined for your tier or in your ESA.
